        <h3>Stay active with these exercise routines:</h3>
        <p>People who exercise regularly have better mental health and emotional wellbeing, and lower rates of mental illness.
            Exercise is important for people with mental illness – it not only boosts our mood, concentration and alertness, but improves our cardiovascular and overall physical health.
            Exercise doesn’t have to be strenuous, structured or take a long time to have benefits. </p>
        <h3>Why does exercise make us feel better, mentally?</h3>

        <p>Often, people who exercise regularly do it simply because it makes them feel good. Exercise can boost your mood, concentration and alertness. It can even help give you a positive outlook on life.
            The link between exercise and mental health is complicated.</p>
            <ul><li>Exercise can distract you from negative thoughts and provide opportunities to try new experiences.</li>
                <li>It offers an opportunity to socialise and get social support if you exercise with others.</li>
                <li>Exercise increases your energy levels.</li>
                <li>Physical activity can be an outlet for your frustrations.</li>
                <li>Exercise can reduce skeletal muscle tension, which helps you feel more relaxed.</li></ul>
            
        <p style="padding-bottom: 50px;">The physical benefits of exercise are also important for people with mental illness. 
        It improves your cardiovascular health and overall physical health. 
        This is important because people with mental health issues are at a higher risk of suffering from chronic physical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and asthma.
        </p>

        <div class="adult">
        <h2>For adults:</h2>
<p>Adults should be active most days, preferably every day. Each week, adults should do either:</p>

<ul><li>2.5 to 5 hours of moderate intensity physical activity – such as a brisk walk, golf, mowing the lawn or swimming</li>
    <li>1.25 to 2.5 hours of vigorous intensity physical activity – such as jogging, aerobics, fast cycling, soccer or netball</li>
    <li>An equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activities.</li></ul>

<h3>Include muscle-strengthening activities as part of your daily physical activity on at least 2 days each week. This can be:</h3>

<ul><li>push-ups</li>
    <li>pull-ups</li>
    <li>squats or lunges</li>
    <li>lifting weights</li>
    <li>household tasks that involve lifting, carrying or digging</li></ul>

<p>Doing any physical activity is better than doing none. If you do no physical activity right now, start by doing some, then slowly build up to the recommended amount.
Physical activity doesn’t have to be structured. Making some small changes to your daily routine can make a big difference. For example, you could:</p>

<ul><li>walk or ride your bike for short trips instead of driving</li>
    <li>drive to a ‘park and ride’ spot, and walk or ride your bike the rest of the way</li>
    <li>use the stairs instead of the lift or escalator</li>
    <li>get off the bus one stop earlier and walk the rest of the way</li>
    <li>park further away from your destination and walk</li>
    <li>walk to the park to eat lunch.</li>
    <li>reduce the time you spend sitting – for example, by organising walking meetings, using a standing desk, or enjoying a walk during your lunch break</li>
    <li>break up long periods of sitting – for example, by doing lunges or star jumps or walking around when on the phone</li></ul>
</div>
<div class="babu">
<h2>For pregnancy:</h2>
<p>If you and your baby are healthy, This means being active most days, preferably every day, to a weekly total of either:</p>
    <ul><li>2.5 to 5 hours of moderate intensity physical activity</li>
        <li>1.25 to 2.5 hours of vigorous intensity physical activity</li>
        <li>an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activities</li></ul>
<h3>Include both aerobic and muscle strengthening exercises in your daily routine, which could include:</h3>

<ul><li>brisk walking</li>
    <li>stationary cycling</li>
    <li>swimming</li>
    <li>dancing</li></ul>
<h3>light resistance activities:</h3>

<p>Physical activity during pregnancy doesn’t have to be vigorous to be beneficial.

For a simple way to measure intensity, try the ‘talk test’. You should be able to carry on a conversation during moderate intensity activities, but in vigorous intensity activities you would find this difficult.</p>

<h3>Safety precautions:</h3>

<p>As your pregnancy progresses and your body changes, you might have to modify your physical activity. Avoid any activity that:</p>

<ul><li>has a high risk of falling or collision</li>
    <li>requires heavy lifting</li>
    <li>has significant changes in pressure (such as sky diving or scuba diving)</li>
    <li>gives you pain or discomfort.</li></ul>

<p>To exercise safely:</p>

<ul><li>stay well hydrated</li>
    <li>avoid exercising in hot weather, especially in high humidity</li>
    <li>avoid standing still or lying down for long periods</li>
    <li>avoid physical activity at high altitude (above 2,000 metres)</li>
    <li>always wear appropriate shoes, non-restrictive clothing</li></ul>

<h3>Pregnancy complications:</h3>
<p>If you have complications get expert advice from a health professional before starting, continuing or returning to physical activity.</p>

<ul><li>reduce the time you spend sitting</li>
    <li>break up long periods of sitting or standing still.</li></ul>

</div>
<div class="old">
<h2>For Old-aged:</h2>
<p>For people aged 65 years and over, we recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on most, preferably all, days.</p>

<ul><li>If you find 30 minutes difficult right now, start with just 10 minutes once or twice a day. After 2 weeks, increase to 15 minutes twice a day.</li>

    <li>If you can do more than 30 minutes, you will get extra benefits.</li>

    <li> the course of the week, try to incorporate different types of activities.</li>

    <li>Try to reduce the time you spend sitting down – break that time up as often as you can.</li></ul>

<h3>Moderate fitness activities:</h3>
<p>Fitness activities are good for your heart, lungs and blood vessels, and can include:</p>

<ul><li>brisk walking</li>
    <li>swimming</li>

    <li>aerobics or water aerobics</li>

</div>
<div class="cro">
<h2>For people with disability or chronic conditions:</h2>
<p>For some people with disability, physical activity can be a challenge. This can be due to mobility issues or a lack of accessible and inclusive gyms and other exercise spaces.

if you have:</p>
<ul><li>heart problems, diabetes or asthma – you can start moderate walking or swimming</li>
    <li>arthritis – you can try hydrotherapy or swimming in a warm pool</li>
