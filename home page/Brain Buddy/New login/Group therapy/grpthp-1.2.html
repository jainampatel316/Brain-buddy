  <p class="para">Attending group therapy conducted by a psychiatrist offers several benefits. 
    Firstly, it provides a supportive environment where individuals can share experiences and gain perspectives from others facing similar challenges. 
    <br><br><br><b><i>Group therapy fosters a sense of belonging and reduces feelings of isolation.</i></b><br><br><br>
    It offers opportunities for interpersonal skill development, as participants learn to communicate effectively and empathize with others. 
    The diverse group dynamic can enhance self-awareness and provide different coping strategies. 
    Overall, group therapy led by a psychiatrist can be a valuable complement to individual treatment, 
    promoting emotional well-being and personal growth.

    Groups can act as a support network and a sounding board. 
    Other members of the group often help you come up with specific ideas for improving a difficult situation or life challenge, and hold you accountable along the way.
    Regularly talking and listening to others also helps you put your own problems in perspective. 
    Many people experience mental health difficulties, but few speak openly about them to people they don't know well. 
    <br><br><br><b><i>Oftentimes, you may feel like you are the only one struggling — but you're not.</i></b><br><br><br> 
    It can be a relief to hear others discuss what they're going through, and realize you're not alone</p>
