          <div class="one"> 1. Is my conversation with the counsellor, private and confidential?<br><br>
            Yes, all information shared by a client with the counselors is safe, secure and confidential.</div>

          <div class="two"> 2.Will I get to talk with the same counselor who I was comfortable sharing my concerns with in the previous sessions?<br><br>
            We understand the need to speak to the same individual, but this is not possible because we are a 24x7 operation.
            Our counselors work in shifts, so it is quite likely that when you call back, the same counselor may not be on duty. 
            However, keeping the comfort factor into consideration, we will soon be starting our paid service where 
            you can choose a counselor from our panel and schedule an appointment to consult the same counselor as many times as you wish to.</div>

           <div class="thr">3.How do I know that I am suffering from a mental disorder?<br><br>
             If you are feeling that your mental health may be suffering, you can record your symptoms and take a few tests available online.
             However, do note that these are not very accurate. 
             The best way is to speak to a professional therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist.</div>

           <div class="fou">4.Can I ask for a female/male counselor considering the issues I am facing?<br><br>
             Yes you can. You can ask the counselor attending your call to inform the team and if the specific gender preference counselor is available, 
             he/she will reach out to you.</div>
            <div class="fiv">5.What Does a Therapist Do?<br><br>
              Therapists are here to help you heal and give you hope for a better future. There are a few different ways they can do this, but they all center around helping you understand yourself.
             Therapists provide a judgement-free space for you to feel whatever you are feeling. 
              You can talk about whatever is on your mind and know that it’s okay. 
              They will provide support and teach you problem-solving skills and coping strategies that will help you identify triggers, 
              manage symptoms, improve communication skills, and boost your self-confidence.
               This is helpful when it comes to managing any major life transition,
               not just when it comes to processing grief and trauma.</div>
            <div class="six">6.Can You Help with Prolonged and Complicated Grief?<br><br>
              Prolonged and complicated grief occurs when grief doesn’t heal over time. 
              It can be diagnosed as late as one or more years after the incident that caused you to grieve has passed.
              If this sounds familiar, we strongly recommend you seek professional help. 
              There’s usually a reason you can’t find resolution. 
              Our therapists will help you understand the process and take meaningful steps towards healing. 
              View our Treatment Modalities page to learn more.</div>
            <div class="sev">7.Do You Accept Insurance?<br><br>
              Yes, we accept Aetna and BCBS. We also accept payment by cash, check, major credit cards, HSA, FSA, and Victims of Crime. 
              You can find more information on our Rates & Insurance page.
              Please feel free to call our office if you have any questions or concerns about payment.</div>
            <div class="eig">8.Will I Have to Take Medication?<br><br>
              The decision to take medication or not is one you should make with your primary care provider or psychiatrist. 
              Medication can alleviate symptoms enough to allow you to function again, but it won’t treat the underlying causes of your concerns and help you make long-term changes. 
              In some cases, therapy alone will be enough to help you achieve your goals.
              In other causes, your health care team may recommend a combination of therapy and medication.
              We are more than happy to work with your doctor to provide a holistic approach that achieves the best results.</div>
